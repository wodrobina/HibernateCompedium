# A compendium of knowledge about one to many connections in JPA

Document is on [post](https://vladmihalcea.com/the-best-way-to-map-a-onetomany-association-with-jpa-and-hibernate/) which shows the different ways of mapping `@oneToMany`. The entry does not cover all the possibilities of creating this type of relationship and the mode of operation, which I intend to expand in this document.

In my examples, I will use the relationship between the entities `Product` and` Review`. At the outset, I assume ** a two-way relationship ** between objects where `Product` will be the dominant one.

## Product
### Class description

A class that is widely understood as a reflection of a product or service in the system.

### Fields description
- id - identifier, annotation `@Id` is required by JPA
- name - description of an item
- reviews - these are reviews of a given product, one product may have multiple reviews

The product is a unique entity, therefore the `equals` and` hashCode` methods have been implemented as suggested[Vlad Michalcea 
](https://vladmihalcea.com/how-to-implement-equals-and-hashcode-using-the-jpa-entity-identifier/).

### Basic implementation of entitity
```java
@Entity
public class Product {

    @Id
    private Integer id;

    private String name;

    @OneToMany
    private Set<Review> reviews = new HashSet<>();

    protected Product() {
    }

    public Product(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public Integer getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void addReview(Review review){
        reviews.add(review);
    }

    public void removeReview(Review review){
        reviews.remove(review);
    }

    public Set<Review> getReviews() {
        return reviews;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) {
            return true;
        }
        if (!(o instanceof Product)) {
            return false;
        }
        return id != null && id.equals(((Product) o).id);
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return getClass().hashCode();
    }

}

```
### SQL code that is generated by JPA

```sql
    create table product (
       id int4 not null,
        name varchar(255),
        primary key (id)
    )
```

## Review
### Class description

A class that is a review model for e.g. a product that is being sold.

### Fields description

- id - identifier, annotation `@Id` is required by JPA
- text - review text

### Basic implementation of entitity

```java
@Entity
public class Review {

    @Id
    private Integer id;

    private String text;

    protected Review() {
    }

    public Review(String text) {
        this.text = text;
    }

    public Integer getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public String getText() {
        return text;
    }

    public void setText(String text) {
        this.text = text;
    }

    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) {
            return true;
        }
        if (!(o instanceof Review)) {
            return false;
        }
        return id != null && id.equals(((Review) o).id);
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return getClass().hashCode();
    }

}

```
### SQL code that is generated by JPA

```sql
    create table review (
       id int4 not null,
        text varchar(255),
        primary key (id)
    )
```

#J PA Behavior Tests for various annotations and settings
## Test code
```java
    @Test
    @Transactional
    void test01() throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
        //GIVEN
        Iterable<Review> savedReviews = createReviews();
        Product product = createProduct(savedReviews);

        //WHEN
        Optional<Product> byId = productRepository.findById(product.getId());

        //THEN
        byId.get().getReviews()
            .forEach(Review::getText);
    }

    private Product createProduct(Iterable<Review> savedReviews) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
        return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
                Product item = new Product("item");
                savedReviews.forEach(item::addReview);
                return productRepository.save(item);
            }, executor)
            .get();
    }

    private Iterable<Review> createReviews() throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
        return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> reviewRepository.saveAll(List.of(
                new Review("first review"),
                new Review("second review"),
                new Review("third review")
            )), executor)
            .get();
    }
```

The test looks very complex, but in fact it creates three `Reviews` with text and writes in a dedicated thread and then we wait for the return of the saved entities from the database. The next step is to create a `Product` in a dedicated thread, additionally linking the already saved` Review` to the object. We wait for the return from the database, then we download the `Product` from the database and iterate through the` Review` it has when reading the text.
Why did I use `CompletableFuture`? This is a way to bypass the JPA level 1 cache. If I hadn't, the results of my tests would not show all the queries because JPA would be accessing the cache instead of accessing the data.

## Use `EAGER`
In the `Product` class, use the binding as below
```java
    @OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
    private Set<Review> reviews = new HashSet<>();
```
The sql code creates an additional join table
```sql
    create table product_reviews (
       product_id int4 not null,
        reviews_id int4 not null,
        primary key (product_id, reviews_id)
    )
```

## Generatedd query

```java
    select
        product0_.id as id1_0_0_,
        product0_.name as name2_0_0_,
        reviews1_.product_id as product_1_1_1_,
        review2_.id as reviews_2_1_1_,
        review2_.id as id1_2_2_,
        review2_.text as text2_2_2_ 
    from
        product product0_ 
    left outer join
        product_reviews reviews1_ 
            on product0_.id=reviews1_.product_id 
    left outer join
        review review2_ 
            on reviews1_.reviews_id=review2_.id 
    where
        product0_.id=?
```

## Conclusion
Query is extensive. We still use the link table, which is completely redundant because it does not carry additional information and we have a direct link between `Product` and` Review`. You can see that the query fields belong to both objects.

This form of the query should have been expected because we explicitly declared that all data should be retrieved and that we would map it to the objects appropriately.

## Use `LAZY`

In the `Product` class, use the binding as below
```java
    @OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    private Set<Review> reviews = new HashSet<>();
```
The sql code creates an additional join table
```sql
    create table product_reviews (
       product_id int4 not null,
        reviews_id int4 not null,
        primary key (product_id, reviews_id)
    )
```
## Generatedd query

        product0_.id as id1_0_0_,
        product0_.name as name2_0_0_ 
    from

    where
        product0_.id=?
```
```sql
    select
        reviews0_.product_id as product_1_1_0_,
        reviews0_.reviews_id as reviews_2_1_0_,
        review1_.id as id1_2_1_,
        review1_.text as text2_2_1_ 
    from
        product_reviews reviews0_ 
    inner join
        review review1_ 
            on reviews0_.reviews_id=review1_.id 
    where
        reviews0_.product_id=?
```

## Conclusion
The result of calling query is as expected. It will be a bit more optimal because JPA tries to optimize the use of the database, and thus the minimum necessary amount of data was collected when searching for an object. This was the first query. Proxy objects have been created for the data marked as `LAZY`. 
The test is intentionally designed to force the download of lazy objects. It can be seen that another query is created to retrieve the missing `Review`. I do not focus on query execution time because this test is performed individually in a changing environment.
